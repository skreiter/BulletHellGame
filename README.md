# BulletHellGame
Bullet Hell Shooting game created with C# and MonoGame - In Progress

This project was created for CPTS 487 at Washington State University.
The primary goals were to learn design patterns.

Currently, stages are not really implemented. Level design will be done with JSON files soon.
All level data including amount of enemies spawned, time spawned, position spawned and player data are loaded from JSON files.
